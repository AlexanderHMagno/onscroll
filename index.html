    <h2>Collecting Plastic Bottles</h2>
    <p>An estimated 8 million metrics tons of plastic trash ends up in our oceans every year. The ocean currents have
      formed five gigantic, slow moving whirlpools where the plastic collects, called gyres. Most of the plasticdebris
      sinks or remains in the gyres, however a significant percentage of it washes onto our coastlines daily. We help
      clean rubbish from the oceans with the aid of fishermen. 165 fishing boats from eastern Spain help to recover the
      plastic used. </p>
